# Todos Example for Feathers

This [Feathers](http://feathersui.com/) example mocks up a simple application to track things that need to get done. It extends the MetalWorksMobileTheme and uses a custom list item renderer that can switch into an editing mode to delete items.

## Requirements

In addition to Starling Framwork and Feathers, this example project requires the MetalWorksMobileTheme example theme. You can find the SWC file for this theme at the following location in the Feathers release build:

	themes/MetalWorksMobileTheme/swc/MetalWorksMobileTheme.swc
